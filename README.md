# DataAnalyst_DK

### Welcome! I attached the code for data processing and the image/plot of the exercise. Please consider those factors
1. Flow column is interpreted as follows: 1 is output (i.e., a positive balance), and 2 is an input (i.e., a negative balance) 
2. Some plots highlight Denmark for the analysis
3. The data do not contain info or more countries, so the balance is adjusted just for Europe
4. you will also find the code with the data processing, is very short but do most of the work and organize the data 

#### Quick analysis of results 

- Denmark shows positive trades for all the types (E, I, K). In particular, Deutschland shows negative balances for operations E and K and Netherlands for type I
- The flow in kg also is positive for Denmark and most of the countries in Europe 
- The share of Denmark in the overall flow is around 2%, Deutschland is the leading country with 24% followed by Italy

### Final note:

I don't speak Danish, but I'm a quick learner :)
